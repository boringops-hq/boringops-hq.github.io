**The embodiment of calm technology**.  
It is:

- **A mindset**: predictability, trust, and stability over hype.  
- **A discipline**: consistency, standards, and stewardship.  
- **A principal**: true innovation thrives only when the foundation is boring and solid.  

This is the unglamorous foundation that makes everything else possible.  
We call it **BoringOps**.
